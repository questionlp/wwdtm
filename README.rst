Wait Wait Stats Library
***********************

**NOTE:** This version of the Wait Wait Stats Library contained in this
repository is currently in its early stages of development and should not be
considered stable or ready for use. There will be breaking changes made and
significant amount of refactoring left to do as code is ported into this new
library.

For the current version of the library, check out the `libwwdtm`_ repository.

Overview
========

This project provides a Python library that provides an interface to
retrieve data from a copy of the `Wait Wait Stats Database`_.

Requirements
============

This version of the library is developed to use features that are included
in Python 3.8; and, thus, is the minimum version of Python supported.

In addition to the Python version requirement, the library depends on a copy
of the `Wait Wait Stats Database`_ that runs on MariaDB or MySQL.

Running Tests
=============

Included in this repository are tests that are written for use with ``pytest``.
To run the tests, simply run: ``pytest`` from the root of the repository.

A performance testing script is also included in the repository named,
``perf_test.py`` that tests the core class methods. This script can be used
to create a performance baseline and also used to track changes in performance
between code changes or configuration changes.

Documentation
=============

This project uses `reStructuredText`_ located in docstrings and individual
files for its documentation and makes use of `Sphinx`_ to build an HTML
(and other formats supported by Sphinx) version of documents. To build the
documentation for this project, use ``venv``, ``virtualenv`` or a similar tool
of your choice to create a virtual environment under ``docs/`` and install the
required packages in ``docs/requirements.txt``, including Sphinx and the
`Flask`_ theme.

The documentation style guide closely follows the one documented in the
`Python Developer's Guide`_.

Once the required packages are installed, an HTML version of the documentation
can be generated by running:

.. code-block:: shell

    make html

An online version of the documentation is also available at `docs.wwdt.me`_
